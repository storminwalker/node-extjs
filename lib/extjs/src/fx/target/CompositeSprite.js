 * @class Ext.fx.target.CompositeSprite

This class represents a animation target for a {@link Ext.draw.CompositeSprite}. It allows
each {@link Ext.draw.Sprite} in the group to be animated as a whole. In general this class will not be
created directly, the {@link Ext.draw.CompositeSprite} will be passed to the animation and
and the appropriate target will be created.
