/**
 * This class is a base class for an event domain. In the context of MVC, an "event domain"
 * is one or more base classes that fire events to which a Controller wants to listen. A
 * controller listens to events by describing the selectors for events of interest to it.
 *
 * Matching selectors to the firer of an event is one key aspect that defines an event
 * domain. All event domain instances must provide a `match` method that tests selectors
 * against the event firer.
 *
 * When an event domain instance is created (typically as a `singleton`), its `type`
 * property is used to catalog the domain in the
 * {@link Ext.app.EventDomain#instances Ext.app.EventDomain.instances} map.
 *
 * There are five event domains provided by default:
 *
 * -   {@link Ext.app.domain.Component Component domain}. This is the primary event domain that
 * has been available since Ext JS MVC was introduced. This domain is defined as any class that
 * extends {@link Ext.Component}, where the selectors use
 * {@link Ext.ComponentQuery#query Ext.ComponentQuery}.
 * -   {@link Ext.app.domain.Global Global domain}. This domain provides Controllers with access
 * to events fired from {@link Ext#globalEvents} Observable instance. These events represent
 * the state of the application as a whole, and are always anonymous. Because of this, Global
 * domain does not provide selectors at all.
 * -   {@link Ext.app.domain.Controller Controller domain}. This domain includes all classes
 * that extend {@link Ext.app.Controller}. Events fired by Controllers will be available
 * within this domain; selectors are either Controller's {@link Ext.app.Controller#id id} or
 * '*' wildcard for any Controller.
 * -   {@link Ext.app.domain.Store Store domain}. This domain is for classes extending
 * {@link Ext.data.AbstractStore}. Selectors are either Store's
 * {@link Ext.data.AbstractStore#storeId storeId} or '*' wildcard for any Store.
 * -   {@link Ext.app.domain.Direct Direct domain}. This domain includes all classes that extend
 * {@link Ext.direct.Provider}. Selectors are either Provider's {@link Ext.direct.Provider#id id}
 * or '*' wildcard for any Provider. This domain is optional and will be loaded only if
 * {@link Ext.direct.Manager} singleton is required in your application.
 *
