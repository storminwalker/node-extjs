/**
 * This plugin provides drag and/or drop functionality for a {@link Ext.grid.View GridView}.
 *
 * It creates a specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone} which knows how to drag out of a {@link
 * Ext.grid.View GridView} and loads the data object which is passed to a cooperating {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone}'s
 * methods with the following properties:
 *
 * - `copy` : {@link Boolean}
 *
 *   The value of the {@link Ext.grid.View GridView}'s `copy` property, or `true` if the GridView was configured with `allowCopy: true` _and_
 *   the control key was pressed when the drag operation was begun.
 *
 * - `view` : {@link Ext.grid.View GridView}
 *
 *   The source GridView from which the drag originated.
 *
 * - `ddel` : HtmlElement
 *
 *   The drag proxy element which moves with the mouse
 *
 * - `item` : HtmlElement
 *
 *   The GridView node upon which the mousedown event was registered.
 *
 * - `records` : {@link Array}
 *
 *   An Array of {@link Ext.data.Model Model}s representing the selected data being dragged from the source {@link Ext.grid.View GridView}.
 *
 * It also creates a specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DropZone} which cooperates with other DropZones which are
 * members of the same ddGroup which processes such data objects.
 *
 * Adding this plugin to a view means that two new events may be fired from the client GridView, `{@link #beforedrop
 * beforedrop}` and `{@link #drop drop}`
 *
 *     @example
 *     Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {
 *         storeId:'simpsonsStore',
 *         fields:['name'],
 *         data: [["Lisa"], ["Bart"], ["Homer"], ["Marge"]],
 *         proxy: {
 *             type: 'memory',
 *             reader: 'array'
 *         }
 *     });
 *
 *     Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {
 *         store: 'simpsonsStore',
 *         columns: [
 *             {header: 'Name',  dataIndex: 'name', flex: true}
 *         ],
 *         viewConfig: {
 *             plugins: {
 *                 ptype: 'gridviewdragdrop',
 *                 dragText: 'Drag and drop to reorganize'
 *             }
 *         },
 *         height: 200,
 *         width: 400,
 *         renderTo: Ext.getBody()
 *     });

    /**
     * @event beforedrop
     * **This event is fired through the GridView. Add listeners to the {@link Ext.grid.View GridView} object**
     *
     * Fired when a drop gesture has been triggered by a mouseup event in a valid drop position in the GridView.
     * 
     * Returning `false` to this event signals that the drop gesture was invalid, and if the drag proxy will animate
     * back to the point from which the drag began.
     * 
     * The dropHandlers parameter can be used to defer the processing of this event. For example to wait for the result of 
     * a message box confirmation or an asynchronous server call. See the details of this property for more information.
     *  
     *     @example
     *     view.on('beforedrop', function(node, data, overModel, dropPosition, dropHandlers) {
     *         // Defer the handling
     *         dropHandlers.wait = true;
     *         Ext.MessageBox.confirm('Drop', 'Are you sure', function(btn){
     *             if (btn === 'yes') {
     *                 dropHandlers.processDrop();
     *             } else {
     *                 dropHandlers.cancelDrop();
     *             }
     *         });
     *     });
     * 
     * Any other return value continues with the data transfer operation, unless the wait property is set.
     *
     * @param {HTMLElement} node The {@link Ext.grid.View GridView} node **if any** over which the mouse was positioned.
     *
     * Any other return value continues with the data transfer operation.
     *
     * @param {Object} data The data object gathered at mousedown time by the cooperating
     * {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone}'s {@link Ext.dd.DragZone#getDragData getDragData} method it contains the following
     * properties:
     * @param {Boolean} data.copy The value of the GridView's `copy` property, or `true` if the GridView was configured with
     * `allowCopy: true` and the control key was pressed when the drag operation was begun
     * @param {Ext.grid.View} data.view The source GridView from which the drag originated.
     * @param {HTMLElement} data.ddel The drag proxy element which moves with the mouse
     * @param {HTMLElement} data.item The GridView node upon which the mousedown event was registered.
     * @param {Ext.data.Model[]} data.records An Array of {@link Ext.data.Model Model}s representing the selected data being
     * dragged from the source GridView.
     *
     * @param {Ext.data.Model} overModel The Model over which the drop gesture took place.
     *
     * @param {String} dropPosition `"before"` or `"after"` depending on whether the mouse is above or below the midline
     * of the node.
     *
     * @param {Object} dropHandlers
     * This parameter allows the developer to control when the drop action takes place. It is useful if any asynchronous
     * processing needs to be completed before performing the drop. This object has the following properties:
     * 
     * @param {Boolean} dropHandlers.wait Indicates whether the drop should be deferred. Set this property to true to defer the drop.
     * @param {Function} dropHandlers.processDrop A function to be called to complete the drop operation.
     * @param {Function} dropHandlers.cancelDrop A function to be called to cancel the drop operation.
